psychogenicFever R Package Documentation

## Introduction
The psychogenicFever R package provides tools for detecting, analyzing, and visualizing patterns of psychogenic fever in medical data. This document describes the main functions included in the package and their usage.

## Function 1: preprocess_temperature_data()

### Purpose
This function preprocesses temperature data by cleaning and formatting it for further analysis.

### Inputs
- `temperature_data`: A data frame containing temperature measurements with columns for timestamps and temperature values.

### Outputs
- A cleaned and formatted data frame ready for analysis.

### Example
```r
# Load the psychogenicFever package
library(psychogenicFever)

# Load sample temperature data
data <- read.csv("temperature_data.csv")

# Preprocess the temperature data
cleaned_data <- preprocess_temperature_data(temperature_data = data)

Function 2: detect_fever_episodes()
Purpose
This function identifies potential episodes of psychogenic fever based on temperature patterns and accompanying psychological factors.
Inputs
•	temperature_data: A data frame containing preprocessed temperature data.
•	psychological_factors: A data frame containing psychological factors data, if available.
Outputs
•	A list of potential psychogenic fever episodes with corresponding timestamps and metadata.
Example
# Detect potential fever episodes
fever_episodes <- detect_fever_episodes(temperature_data = cleaned_data, psychological_factors = psychological_data)

Function 3: visualize_temperature_patterns()
Purpose
This function generates visualizations to explore temperature patterns over time and their relationship with psychological factors.
Inputs
•	fever_episodes: A list of detected fever episodes.
•	psychological_factors: A data frame containing psychological factors data.
•	plot_type: Type of visualization to generate (e.g., line plot, scatter plot).
Outputs
•	Visualizations showing temperature patterns and their correlations with psychological factors.
Example
# Visualize temperature patterns
visualize_temperature_patterns(fever_episodes = fever_episodes, psychological_factors = psychological_data, plot_type = 'line')

Function 4: statistical_analysis()
Purpose
This function conducts statistical analyses to explore associations between psychogenic fever episodes and psychological factors.
Inputs
•	fever_episodes: A list of detected fever episodes.
•	psychological_factors: A data frame containing psychological factors data.
Outputs
•	Summary statistics and test results indicating significant associations between psychogenic fever episodes and psychological factors.
Example
# Perform statistical analysis
stat_results <- statistical_analysis(fever_episodes = fever_episodes, psychological_factors = psychological_data)
